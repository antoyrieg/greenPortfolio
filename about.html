  <p> I was born and raised in Detroit, MI. I have a passion for this community and the people in it 
  - including the bad parts. Aside from my city, I also love music, spending time with family
  and friends. I also love good food. </p>
 <p> Just as Mitch Albom once said,<blockquote> Detroit is a place where we've had it pretty tough.
  But there is a generosity here and a well of kindness that goes deep.  </blockquote> 
<p> People misunderstand Detroit and it's history. Because of that, the city gets written off
as a place with not much hope or much a future. My goal not so much to change people's mindset,
but to help Detroit shine a light (like it once did), that impacts and inspires cities all
around the world. </p>
